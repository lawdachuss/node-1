// UploadSem limits how many video files may upload at the same time.
// Each file still fans out to the configured hosts, and each host has its own
// per-host concurrency cap (see uploader.SetHostConcurrency), so the effective
// ceiling is the more restrictive of the two.  256 concurrent file uploads
// keeps large backlogs draining quickly without overloading the box.

// capacity.  Call once at startup before any upload goroutines begin; in-flight
// acquires on the old channel are drained naturally.
