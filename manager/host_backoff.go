// hostBackoffRefreshInterval is how often a node re-reads the fleet-wide upload
// host backoffs.  The table is tiny (one row per upload host) and the value only
// changes when some node discovers a shared-credential cap, so a slow poll is
// enough: the cost of being up to five minutes late is a single wasted request
// to a host that is already known-exhausted, versus a Supabase round trip on
// every file upload if this were checked live.
const hostBackoffRefreshInterval = 5 * time.Minute

// startHostBackoffSync keeps this node's view of the fleet-wide upload-host
// backoffs fresh, and installs the sink that reports one when this node
// discovers a shared-credential cap.
//
// Why the fleet needs this at all: the upload credentials are the same on every
// node, so an upload host's per-account quota is a fleet quota.  VidMoly caps
// its API at 50 requests/day for the whole fleet, and the live key showed
// used_today 2416 — 18 nodes each spending their own request to rediscover the
// same exhausted cap, again after every ~6-hour CI restart.  With this table one
// node's discovery skips the host everywhere.
