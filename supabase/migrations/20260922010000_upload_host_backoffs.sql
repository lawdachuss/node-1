-- upload_host_backoffs: fleet-wide backoff for shared upload-host credentials.
--
-- Why a shared lease is needed here.  The upload credentials are identical on
-- every node (they come from the same GitHub Actions secrets), so a per-account
-- cap is really a FLEET cap.  Live evidence (2026-09-22 05:32 UTC,
-- GET https://vidmoly.me/api/upload/server?key=…):
--
--   {"status":429,"msg":"Daily API limit reached (50).","limit":50,
--    "used_today":2416,"remaining_today":0}
--
-- 50 requests/day, 2,416 spent.  The per-process `timedDisabled` map
-- (uploader/uploader.go) can only ever teach ONE node about that; the other 17
-- each spend their own request to rediscover it, and every node that restarts
-- (the CI runners rotate every ~6h) pays again.  This table carries the verdict
-- between nodes so discovery costs one request fleet-wide, not one per node.
--
-- Contract:
--   * host        — the uploader host name exactly as the fleet names it
--                   ("VidMoly", "Vidara", …), primary key so a re-report
--                   upserts instead of piling up rows.
--   * backoff_until — when the host may be retried (the cap's reset time, or a
--                   conservative window for an unknown reset).
--   * reason      — the host's own wording, surfaced in logs.
--   * updated_by  — reporting node id, so a bad entry is traceable.
--
-- A node reads this on a timer (manager/host_backoff.go) and skips the host
-- while the expiry is in the future, exactly like its in-process timed disable.
-- Nothing here is authoritative: an expired row is simply ignored, so a stale
-- table can never permanently disable a healthy host.
--
-- Degradation: nodes that have not applied this migration get a PGRST205
-- ("table not in schema cache") and fall back to the old per-node behaviour
-- (database.HostBackoffTableMissing) — no crash, no lost upload.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.
