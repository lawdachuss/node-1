-- Fix notify_requesters_on_upload(): its two queries could not be planned, which
-- silently blocked EVERY insert into upload_links.
--
-- The function was attached as `AFTER INSERT ON public.upload_links` and its first
-- INSERT ... SELECT joined
--
--     public.user_notification_preferences unp ON unp.user_id = rq.user_id
--
-- where `user_notification_preferences.user_id` is uuid and `requests.user_id` is
-- text.  PL/pgSQL plans a statement when it is first reached, so the trigger raised
--
--     42883: operator does not exist: uuid = text
--
-- at parse analysis for each and every insert — independent of the row's data —
-- and PostgREST surfaced it as HTTP 404 on POST /rest/v1/upload_links.  The DVR
-- fleet stores every host upload as an upload_links row, so from the moment this
-- trigger was installed no recording could become "uploaded" in the database
-- again: recordings kept their enqueue-time row with zero links (visible live as
-- 09-21: 100% of recordings had links, 09-22: 264/345, 09-23: 0/98).
--
-- Two casts are needed:
--   * `unp.user_id::text = rq.user_id` — the join that aborted planning;
--   * `pf.user_id::text` in the second branch — user_notifications.user_id is text
--     while performer_follows.user_id is uuid, so the follower branch would have
--     failed with 42804 as soon as a follower match existed.
--
-- `SET search_path = ''` is added too, matching the hardening migration: the body
-- qualifies every table with public.* already, and a SECURITY DEFINER function
-- should not resolve names through a caller-controlled search path.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.  The site repo owns this function; carry the same
-- body there so its next deploy does not revert the fix.
