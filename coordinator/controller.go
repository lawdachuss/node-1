// ============================================================================
// CONTROLLER — leader-elected channel assignment balancer
// ============================================================================
//
// A single node (the leader, elected via a DB lease) is responsible for
// assigning live channels across the fleet. Its behaviour is deliberately NOT
// a continuous reshuffler:
//
//   - Every cycle it recomputes liveness for every pooled channel (Chaturbate
//     via the bulk affiliate API; Stripchat via per-model checks, throttled)
//     and writes is_live, so the whole fleet shares one authoritative,
//     continuously-updated view of live channels on BOTH cb.xxx and stripchat.
//
//   - Assignment (moving channels between nodes) happens ONLY:
//       1. ONCE at startup, after every node is live — an equal split of live
//          channels per site across all active nodes.
//       2. On a membership change — a node goes offline (its channels are
//          reclaimed and redistributed once to the remaining live nodes) or a
//          new node comes online (it receives an equal share).
//
//     A stable, healthy fleet is therefore never reshuffled; each node keeps
//     the channels it was given. This avoids the old "continuous shuffle"
//     problem where channels jumped between nodes every tick.
//
//   - When reassignment does occur, recording channels are NEVER moved
//     (balanceSite only relocates claimed/unassigned rows), so in-progress
//     recordings are never lost.
//
//   - Dead-node housekeeping (reclaim) and offline-non-recording release run
//     every cycle; ReleaseNodeOfflineChannels excludes status=recording, so a
//     live node's in-progress recordings are never disturbed.
//
// Cold-start guard: the one-time assignment waits until ALL nodes are live
// (offlineCount==0). A broken node can never block the fleet forever — after
// cold_start_wait_sec the leader proceeds with whoever is up.
//
// The per-node assignment-sync loop (shuffle.go) still obeys these decisions:
// it starts channels assigned to its node and stops those no longer assigned.
